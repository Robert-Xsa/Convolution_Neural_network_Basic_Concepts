A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is primarily used for image recognition and computer vision tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically learn and extract hierarchical representations of visual data directly from raw pixel inputs.
This projects shows the basic concepts of a Convolution Neural Network by classifying both binary classification and multiple classification.
In binary classification, i used a datasets known as 'human or horse dataset'.
In multiple classification i used a dataset known as 'Dermnet'.
All  practical works were performed online on the kaggle notebook.
